Insurance Shoppers, Inc. is run by Jay and Louise Norris, licensed health insurance brokers who have been helping people make sense of health coverage for twenty five years.

No cookie-cutter plans or pressure tactics. Our focus is helping you understand your options, whether that means walking you through ACA-compliant coverage, comparing plans for your family, or answering complex benefit questions.

We work directly with individuals and small businesses.
