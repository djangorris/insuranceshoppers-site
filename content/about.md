Insurance Shoppers, Inc. is run by Jay Norris, a licensed health insurance broker who’s been helping people make sense of health coverage for more than two decades.

We don’t believe in cookie-cutter plans or pressure tactics. Our focus is helping you understand your options, whether that means walking you through ACA-compliant coverage, comparing plans for your family, or answering complex benefit questions.

We work directly with individuals and small businesses. If you want someone to explain your options like a human, not a salesperson, you’re in the right spot.
